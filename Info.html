It takes much less for someone, including children, to overdose or die. Even a tiny amount, around two milligrams, of fentanyl can kill. Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid approved for treating severe pain with a prescription. Fentanyl is 50 times stronger than heroin and 100 times stronger than morphine, making it effective in pain relief but also more likely to cause overdose if misused.
